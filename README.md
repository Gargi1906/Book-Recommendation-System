# Book-Recommendation-System
Welcome to my Book Recommendation System project! This project is designed to fetch and display personalized book recommendations using the Google Books API based on user preferences such as genre and author.

# Overview

Users can search for books by entering a genre and author, or simply explore general book recommendations provided on page load.
